Hey there :wave:, welcome to **Orbita Studios**! We are a team of enthusiasts which love the Source Engine. Our goal is 
<br>
to bring modern-day graphics to the Source Engine, with additional support for other platforms, we also want to make High Quality Source Engine projects.
<br>
We (the developers) come together to make "Heavily modified Source Engine" which is meant for modern day use.

## Projects
* [Lambda Complex: Source](https://github.com/OrbitaStudios/LambdaComplexSource) - A faithful recreation of the original GoldSrc game Opposing Force and a "heavily modified Source Engine", this "Heavily modified Source Engine" will be used as a base project for upcoming projects.
